;Okay this is much faster (probably b/c of bitmap optimization, though -- not lux per se).
;And the interactions are more full-featured than 2htdp.
;But my code is getting messy.
;Also, need to bring back water animations (enhance the cache-render baking process...)
;Need to support multiple ground types (not just two).  Some way of declaring symbol->tile mappings
